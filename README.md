# MonitorFramework

## Some important things
- Inside settings.json you can set your webhook and timeout that framework look for changes in links.csv file
- `links.csv` is to send data into threads
- Don't try to input anything inside id column inside links.csv - it may cause strange behaviour
- Use logging to print inside every single thread
